FRONTEND TASKLIST:

Phase 1:
[X] - Fix Safari issue with JQuery positioning of the nav-bar.
[ ] - Optimize images for load time

Phase 3:
[ ] - Refactor CSS/HTML & any other ugly working code.

[ ] - Test cross-browser & platform implementation
Phase 5: 
[ ] - Live Stream? Is this an actual feature? If so, research & implementation.
