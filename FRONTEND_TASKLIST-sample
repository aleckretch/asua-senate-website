FRONTEND TASKLIST:

Phase 1:
[ ] - Fix Safari issue with JQuery positioning of the nav-bar.
[ ] - Optimize images for load time
[ ] - Fix main div in Firefox (expands too wide and causes side-scrolling)
[ ] - Main senate logo was cropped improperly.
[ ] - Adjust the heights on the li elements and the nav bar during scroll to more closely reflect the design.
Phase 2:
[ ] - Populate main body with filler content (pictures, calendar, etc)
[ ] - Start onclick overlay for Senate profile. Plugin or custom code?
Phase 3:
[ ] - Refactor CSS/HTML & any other ugly working code.
[ ] - Responsive CSS (we're good already down to about 6-700ish pixels width, need at least 2 more media queries--one for collapse, one for mobile.)
Phase 4: 
[ ] - Calendar (possible AngularJS?) implementation.
[ ] - Test cross-browser & platform implementation
Phase 5: 
[ ] - Live Stream? Is this an actual feature? If so, research & implementation.
